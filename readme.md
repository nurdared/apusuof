<h1>Students' Union Online Forum</h1>
Every students’ life during university years proceeding fast and achieving a balance between academics and social life is quite challenging. University is a place, full of wonderful opportunities, knowledge, friendships and unforgettable memories. However, the university life goes not the same way for every person, as there are thousands of students with their own characteristics and personalities, where half of them might be easy adaptable and sociable and other half might be shy and closed. Especially this case is true for the foreign students joining Malaysia Universities every year. According to a study, most of the foreign students enrolled to Malaysia limit their abilities to be fully involved in university life due to the challenges with language, culture, food and care, which makes them feel lonely, isolated and not confident (Mahmuda, et al., 2010). That is the reason why UK and USA universities do practice having the “Student Union”, where the help, support and interesting university life is provided to the students, having various clubs and planning different meetings and events, where the main goal is to unite local and foreign students together, improve their efficiency, help to build self-confidence and make their lives as interesting and fun as possible (Wineki, 2010). Feeling of comfortability and familiarity, help and support, advices and efficient services provided by the university may help the students to balance and enjoy their time throughout the university journey. 
Due to the fact that “Students’ Union” is found to very beneficial to the university and university students, especially when it comes to the top universities, enrolling thousands of the students every year, I have decided to come up with “APU Students` Union Online Forum”, where the students will be able to find all the information and help related to their interests and issues regarding the university online. So, APU SUOF will be divided into 5 different sections, which are:
•	Clubs and Societies – forum where will be all related information about clubs and societies, updates, proper timetable of meetings, discussions and tournaments coming
•	Lost and Found – forum where students will help each other with items lost and found
•	Volunteering – forum where will be discussed all information for upcoming volunteering events, which offers vital help to people in need, as well as getting involved in other kind of working experiences.
•	Upcoming Events – all information related to the main upcoming events, within and outside of campus 
•	Q and A – forum where students will get help from other students with their different kind of problems related to study, asking right learning resources, or any kind of problems faced.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
